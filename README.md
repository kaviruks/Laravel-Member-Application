# The Laravel project in this repository showcases the use of mutators, casting, and factories.
This Laravel project in the repository includes examples of mutators and casting implemented in the Member.php model file, and a factory example implemented in the MemberFactory.php file located in the factories folder. Mutators modify model attributes and casting is used to transform attribute types. The factory example demonstrates how to generate test data.
